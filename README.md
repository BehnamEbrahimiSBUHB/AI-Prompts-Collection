  <h1>AI Prompts Collection</h1>
  <p>A curated repository of prompts, instructions, and guides for interacting with various AI models.</p>
</div>

This repository is a collection of resources designed to help developers, prompt engineers, and AI enthusiasts get the most out of generative AI models like Gemini, OpenAI's GPT series, and GitHub Copilot.

## What's Inside

This collection is organized into several key directories, each serving a specific purpose:

- **`.github/`**: The core of the collection, containing resources for enhancing your AI-assisted development workflow.
  - **`prompts/`**: A wide range of prompts for common software development tasks, such as creating specifications, writing commit messages, and optimizing code.
  - **`instructions/`**: Detailed instructions and best practices for various technologies and methodologies, designed to be used with AI assistants like GitHub Copilot.
  - **`chatmodes/`**: Custom chat modes to tailor the behaviour of GitHub Copilot for specific roles or tasks, like a critical thinker or a C#/.NET janitor.

- **`.gemini/`**: Resources specifically for Google's Gemini models.
  - **`commands/`**: TOML command files for the Gemini CLI.
  - **`gemini-for-google-workspace-prompting-guide-101.pdf`**: A guide to prompting Gemini within the Google Workspace ecosystem.

- **`openai/`**: Notebooks and guides for working with OpenAI's GPT models.
  - **`gpt-4.1/`** and **`gpt-5/`**: Contains Jupyter notebooks and markdown files with prompting guides and best practices for different GPT versions.

- **`guides/`**: A collection of guides and text files on various topics, including data science and visualization tools.

## How to Use

The resources in this repository are meant to be used as a reference and a starting point for your own AI interactions.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Prompts-Collection.git
    ```

2.  **Browse the collection:** Explore the directories to find prompts, instructions, and guides relevant to your needs.

3.  **Integrate into your workflow:**
    - Use the prompts in `.github/prompts/` as inspiration or starting points in your interactions with AI chat interfaces.
    - Leverage the files in `.github/instructions/` to provide context to AI assistants like GitHub Copilot, helping them generate more accurate and relevant code.
    - Configure your GitHub Copilot with the `.github/chatmodes/` to align its responses with specific personas or tasks.
