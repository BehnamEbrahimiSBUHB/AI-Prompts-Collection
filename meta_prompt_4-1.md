# GPT-4.1 Meta Prompt for High-Quality Prompt Generation

**Objective:** This meta prompt is a template designed to generate a well-structured, robust, and effective prompt for the GPT-4.1 model. Fill in the sections below to define your task, and the final output will be a prompt tailored to GPT-4.1's strengths.

---

### **1. User's Core Request**

*   **[Enter the user's original, high-level request here. Be as specific as possible. Example: "Create a Python script that analyzes a CSV file of sales data and generates a report."]**

---

### **2. AI's Role and Objective**

*   **Role:** What persona should the AI adopt? (e.g., Expert Python Developer, Helpful Customer Service Agent, Code Refactoring Assistant)
*   **Primary Objective:** What is the single most important goal the AI should achieve? (e.g., Write a clean, efficient, and well-documented Python script; Resolve the user's issue accurately and concisely; Improve the code's readability and performance.)

---

### **3. Key Instructions & Rules**

*   **[List the essential rules and constraints. Be direct and literal. Use bullet points.]**
    *   *Example: "Always include docstrings for every function."*
    *   *Example: "The script must handle potential `FileNotFoundError` exceptions."*
    *   *Example: "Do not use any external libraries outside of pandas and numpy."*
    *   *Example: "Maintain a professional and concise tone."*

---

### **4. Workflow & Reasoning Process**

*   **[Define the step-by-step process the AI should follow. This induces a "Chain of Thought" and improves quality. Use an ordered list.]**
    1.  *Example: "First, clarify the structure of the input CSV file (columns, data types)."*
    2.  *Example: "Second, outline a plan for the script's main functions (e.g., `load_data`, `process_sales`, `generate_report`)."*
    3.  *Example: "Third, write the Python code, adhering to all instructions."*
    4.  *Example: "Finally, add comments to explain complex logic and provide a `README.md` with usage instructions."*

---

### **5. Context & Data**

*   **[Provide all necessary context. This could be code snippets, document excerpts, or data samples. Use Markdown code blocks or XML tags for clarity.]**

    *Example (for a coding task):*
    ```python
    # Existing code to be refactored
    def old_function(data):
        # ... messy code ...
        return result
    ```

    *Example (for a RAG task):*
    ```xml
    <doc id='doc-01' title='Sales Policy'>
    All sales reports must be generated by the 5th of the month.
    </doc>
    ```

---

### **6. Output Format**

*   **[Specify the exact format for the final output. Be precise.]**
    *   *Example: "The final output must be a single Python script file named `report_generator.py`."*
    *   *Example: "Provide the answer in JSON format with the following keys: `summary`, `key_findings`, `data_source`."*
    *   *Example: "The response should be a Markdown document with a main header for the title and sub-headers for each section."*

---

### **7. Examples (Optional but Recommended)**

*   **[Provide one or more clear examples of the desired input-to-output transformation. This is one of the most effective ways to steer the model.]**

    *Example:*
    **User Input:** `"Refactor this function to be more readable."`
    **AI Output:**
    ```python
    def new_function(data):
        """This function improves readability by using clear variable names."""
        # ... clean, refactored code ...
        return result
    ```
